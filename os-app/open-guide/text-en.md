# Shortcuts

<div class="OLSKDecorNotice">

*AccessKey* refers to a one or more shortcut keys followed by a single character. Usually it's `Alt` on Windows or `Control+Alt` on macOS, but it changes [based on your browser and operating system](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_accesskey.asp#table2).

*Launcher* refers to the app's command runner: press `Alt+Space`, type the command, then press `Enter` to run.
